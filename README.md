# Project Cost Estimate

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.6.

This project is an update of an older one I did using @ngrx/signals and removing zone.js (see angular.json).

The purpose of this project is to calculate the minimal effort required to create a customized website with certain features.

The updated features are saved in the local storage. I didn't use a database because it's a very simple app, and you can achieve the same functionality with a simple Excel file.

This app allows you to add and remove features, reorder them, edit the estimated hours needed to implement each feature, and print a draft.

Feel free to clone this app if you find it useful.
